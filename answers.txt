1. we get the same results as in the loglinear model, 0.86 accuracy rate. why is it so?
2. we get 0.72 accuaracy with (len(F2I_uni) * 4) which is 4 times the size of the vocabulary. vocabulary size is 138. so it's 552.
3. we got 755 with random seed untouched with hid dim 15. with hid dim 15 with np.random.seed(0) we need 13464 iterations with glorot init to succeed.
with hid dim 30 we need 6804. with hid dim 90 we need 5011. with hid dm 250 we need 4340
